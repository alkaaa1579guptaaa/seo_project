            satisfaction. If any unethical activity occurs, such as publishing
            articles or posts on unauthorized websites, we honor a money-back
            guarantee. Clients who identify such issues and submit a refund
            claim will be eligible for a full refund or a partial refund through
            discounts, depending on the situation.

            Additionally, we may provide alternatives, such as retrying the
            request on different websites or crediting the amount for future
            use. However, if the client prefers, they can opt for a complete
            refund in the current scenario. Please note that a full refund is
            only applicable when the fault lies in failing to meet our stated
            commitments.

            At BacklinkExplore, we strive to ensure a seamless refund process
            for our clients. Once a refund is approved, the processing time
            typically ranges from 7 to 14 business days, depending on the
            payment method used.

            For credit card payments, the refund may take slightly longer to
            reflect in your account due to standard banking procedures. Refunds
            via digital payment platforms or direct bank transfers are generally
            faster but may still be subject to processing timelines set by your
            financial institution. If you have any questions or concerns about
            your refund status, our support team is always available to assist
            you.

            Once a refund is approved, the processing time depends on the
            payment method used. For Mastercard payments, refunds will typically
            be credited back to your card within 5 to 10 business days. PayPal
            refunds are usually immediate if paid through your PayPal balance,
            but if you used a linked card or bank account, the refund may take
            up to five business days, though it could take longer depending on
            your bank's processing time. Regardless of the payment method,
            refunds will always be returned to the original payment source used
            for the transaction.
